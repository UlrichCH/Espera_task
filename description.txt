Its a quite easy programm the procer thread uses its function to generate packages of randomly slightly off the given measurements and put it into the queue. 
After that he informs the consumer that he has made a new package and waits 1 second until he starts to make a new one. 

The consumer has a 6 seconds Delay to start to represent the "Transportation Time". 
After the Consumer gets informed about a new package in the queue, he reads it check the measeaurments and 
if its in the allowed criteria (he is more precise on that as the producer) he discardes the package or label it.

A complete log is provided in the Console, so you can see what is happenening when, all entries are provided with timestamps, 
name of thread who send them, Id and meseaurment of the package and why they're discard.
